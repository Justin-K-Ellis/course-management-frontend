# Course Management (Frontend)

## About

This is a a small learning management systen that allows users to create, read, update,
and delete information about courses, instructors, and students. For example, users can
view a complete set of courses, change the name and instructor of a given course, or
delete a course, or create a new course. Users can also see a complete list of students,
inspect which courses a given student is registered with, change the student's name,
register the student with a course, deregister a student from a course, delete a student
or create a new student (and so on).

## Technology

The frontend (this repo) is written in React JS and styled with Tailwind CSS and daisuUI
(a component library that builds on Tailwind). It works with a backend (repo [here](https://github.com/Justin-K-Ellis/course-management)) built
with Express.js and PostgreSQL.
